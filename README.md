## Project Benson
###### Week 1

In our first project, we'll get data from a city data portal and do exploratory data analysis to look at patterns in foot traffic in the city. Working in teams, we'll contextualize this exercise using design thinking to create imaginative use cases. Finally, we'll assemble persuasive proposals that communicate our findings and our curiosity using tight verbal and visual communication.

**Due**: Groups will present on **Monday, July 6th**

#### Back story:

Say that you'd like to do some data work for an organization, but they aren't hiring. They might not even know that they could benefit from the data science services of a skilled practitioner like you. How can you get their attention?

For Project Benson, you're going to send a preliminary analysis and a proposal to your organization to try to get your foot in the door. To do this, you'll use free accessible data about the patterns of transit traffic in the city. Your job is to lay out a case that your skills and insights are useful for their unique needs.

#### Data:

 * **acquisition**: download of data from an open repository (aim for 3 months+ worth of data)
 * **storage**: flat files
 * **sources**: New York City Data Portal


#### Skills:

 * data i/o, ipython notebook (jupyter)
 * data exploration, transformations, plotting
 * communication, proposal writing


#### Analysis:

 * aggregation


#### Deliverable/communication:

 * backstory (description of client, their problem, and your proposed solution)
 * proposal to the client
 * visual and oral communication in proposal
 * team presentation of your work


#### Design:

 * question formation and brainstorming
 * empathic design
 * designing in teams


#### Project Details:

In teams of four or five, you will work together to explore the MTA turnstile data and think about patterns that you can extract from the data to inform your potential client about the movement of people in the city. You want to demonstrate your ability to be resourceful with limited resources, to understand the needs of the organization, and to imagine further work you could do with additional time and/or data.

The [01-data_munging Challenge](../../../challenges/challenges_questions/01-mta) will help you get started with your data exploration and get you up to speed with the skills and tools you need to complete this project.

#### Deliverables:

Your team's work will occur in a few stages, each with a deliverable:

1. **Backstory:**  
After familiarizing yourselves with the data, you'll work together to brainstorm what kind of organization you will approach with your proposal. The organization can be real or imaginary, a private company or a social sector group, anything you desire.  
**Due date**: Submit a brief written description of your client/target to all the instructors in slack by end of day **Tuesday 6/30**.

1. **Check in:**  
Each group should have an informal check-in with the instructors about their progress sometime on **Wednesday 7/1**.

1. **Presentation:**  
Your group will present its project to the class as a whole, as a pitch. Presentations will be 8 minutes long, given the afternoon of **Monday, 7/6**. Each team member should speak, a good rule of thumb is to try to evenly divide the 8 minutes among the team. You should use slides with compelling visualizations and text that reinforce your spoken points. You can use whatever slideshow software you prefer -- students have typically used keynote, google slides, or powerpoint in the past.  

#### More info and examples

**Your backstory**

This is a fairly free-form project, and creativity is welcome. Be sure that there is enough time to do good work with the data, but it is fine to tinker with the premise of the project.

For instance, you may decide that an organization has approached *you*, soliciting your help. Here's an example email that a former group "received" from a non-profit: [Example Client Email](./Example_Client_Email.md).
